## Inspiration

Growing up as a passionate gamer and now working as a Data Engineer, I've always been drawn to the intersection of
gaming and data. With this project, I combined two of my greatest passions: gaming and data. Back in the 90' I always
enjoyed the video game series You Don't Know Jack, a delightful blend of trivia and comedy that not only entertained
but also taught me a thing or two. Generally, the usage of games for educational purposes is another concept
that fascinates me.

In 2023, I organized a workshop to teach kids and young adults game development. They learned about mathematical
concepts behind collision detection, yet they had fun as everything was framed in the context of gaming.
It was eye-opening that gaming is not only a huge market but also holds a great potential for knowledge sharing.

Generating SQL queries based on natural language and a given data model is a typical use-case for LLMs especially like
the Snowflake Arctic Instruct model. But what about adding a twist? What if we use it to generate quiz questions based
on a data model, so that the user can learn SQL and get familiar with the data model in a fun and engaging way? The
answer is üèîÔ∏è Arctic Query Quest!

Getting answers from LLMs right away is great, but knowledge sharing and learning falls short often in a business
context. Arctic Query Quest is a proof of concept to revolutionize SQL education in companies, schools and universities.
It is about enabling users rather than simply providing answers.

By feeding the Arctic Instruct LLM with the DDL statements of the model itself together with sample data and the modular
prompt generation approach, that allows to adjust the experience e.g. by changing the difficulty, allows for many
business use-cases, be it onboarding new employees, teaching SQL in schools or universities or simply having fun with
the application.
