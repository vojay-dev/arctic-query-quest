## üí° Inspiration

Growing up as a passionate gamer and now working as a Data Engineer, I've always been drawn to the intersection of
gaming and data. With this project, I combined two of my greatest passions: gaming and data. Back in the 90' I always
enjoyed the video game series You Don't Know Jack, a delightful blend of trivia and comedy that not only entertained
but also taught me a thing or two. Generally, the usage of games for educational purposes is another concept
that fascinates me.

In 2023, I organized a workshop to teach kids and young adults game development. They learned about mathematical
concepts behind collision detection, yet they had fun as everything was framed in the context of gaming.
It was eye-opening that gaming is not only a huge market but also holds a great potential for knowledge sharing.

Generating SQL queries based on natural language and a given data model is a typical use-case for LLMs especially like
the Snowflake Arctic Instruct model. But what about adding a twist? What if we use it to generate quiz questions based
on a data model, so that the user can learn SQL and get familiar with the data model in a fun and engaging way? The
answer is üèîÔ∏è Arctic Query Quest!

Getting answers from LLMs right away is great, but knowledge sharing and learning falls short often in a business
context. Arctic Query Quest is a proof of concept to revolutionize SQL education in companies, schools and universities.
It is about enabling users rather than simply providing answers.

By feeding the Arctic Instruct LLM with the DDL statements of the model itself together with sample data and the modular
prompt generation approach, that allows to adjust the experience e.g. by changing the difficulty, allows for many
business use-cases, be it onboarding new employees, teaching SQL in schools or universities or simply having fun with
the application.

## üéÆ What it does

Arctic Query Quest is a fun and interactive way to learn SQL and get familiar with data models. The user can choose
a data model and a difficulty. Then, a prompt is generated out of several moduls based on the user configuration.

The Snowflake Arctic Instruct model is used to create a quiz using the generated prompt.

The user is then presented with the quiz question and three possible answers, all part of the model response. The user
can make a guess, the app will evaluate the answer and provide an explanation of the correct answer.

### Streamlit web app

#### State management

The Streamlit web app is the main interface for the user. To increase the look and feel of the app, it is not using
multiple pages but a single page with different states. This allows for more complex flows.

The current state is stored in the session state as `st.session_state.app_state`. The app has the following states:

- `start`: The initial state of the app. The user can configure the session, choose a data model and difficulty and start the quiz.
- `quiz`: At this state, the app is interacting with the Arctic model to generate a quiz, including the answers and an explanation of the correct answer. The user is presented with the quiz and can make a guess.
- `evaluate`: Here, the users answer is evaluated and the result is shown.

The state is represented as an `enum` for more type safety:

```py
class AppState(Enum):
    START = "start"
    QUIZ = "quiz"
    EVALUATE = "evaluate"
```

To handle the rendering of the app, all elements are added to an `st.empty()` element called `placeholder`. This allows
to remove elements at any point, or replace several elements at once. In this case it is used to replace all content
when the state changes. That way, the app is implementing a more complex user flow while handling everything with a
single page approach.

With the following helper function, the state is changed easily and also takes care of removing the current content:

```py
def set_state(state: AppState):
    placeholder.empty()
    st.session_state.app_state = state
```

To render the content, each state has its own function. Then main function then simply calls the function based
on the current state:

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    if st.session_state.app_state == AppState.START:
        start()
    elif st.session_state.app_state == AppState.QUIZ:
        quiz()
    elif st.session_state.app_state == AppState.EVALUATE:
        evaluate()
```

#### Configuration and customization

Visual appeal was an important aspect for the implementation of the app. The goal was to make it stand out and use
an overall theme that fits the Arctic theme. To handle this customization and to keep configuration related code
separate from the main logic, a `common.py` file was created.

When rendering the app, the `init_page()` function is called, which covers the following aspects:

```py
def init_page():
    configure()
    init_state()
    apply_style()
    menu()
```

- `configure`: Set page configurations like the layout, which is set to `wide` in this case.
- `init_state`: Initialize the session state by ensuring all state variables are set and use a proper default, such as `app_state`.
- `apply_style`: Reads the file `style.css` and applies this CSS via `st.html("<style>...</style>")`. This keeps CSS separate from the Python code and allows for more complex styling adjustments.
- `menu`: Renders the sidebar.

By keeping the configuration and customization separate, the main logic is more focused and easier to maintain.

Additionally, there are some more special adjustments which I would like to highlight:

**Custom Theme**

The app uses a custom theme defined in the `.streamlit/config.toml` file. This sets a color scheme that fits the Arctic theme.

```toml
[theme]
base="dark"
primaryColor="#32fcff"
backgroundColor="#23232b"
secondaryBackgroundColor="#383844"
```

**CSS**

Via some advanced CSS selectors, also elements which normally can't be styled in Streamlit can be adjusted, for example:

```css
[data-testid^="chatAvatarIcon"] {
    background-color: #32fcff !important;
}
```

**Component Customization**

To improve the look and feel, some components have been customized. For example, the `st.radio()` components has been
extended with a background image depending on the selected model:

```py
model_backgrounds = {
    "Shop": "https://files.janz.sh/arctic/model-shop.jpg",
    "Game": "https://files.janz.sh/arctic/model-game.jpg",
    "Books": "https://files.janz.sh/arctic/model-books.jpg"
}

if background := model_backgrounds.get(db_model, ""):
    st.html(f"<style>.stRadio {{ background: url({background}); }}</style>")
```

### LLM interaction

The interaction is decoupled and modularized with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). This allows to easily switch
between different models.

Furthermore, all model interaction is handled in a separate class called `ArcticClient`. By using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/),
the model response is parsed and validated to a data class:

```py
class ArcticQuiz(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer_1: str
    answer_2: str
    answer_3: str
    correct_answer: int
    explanation: str

# ...

    def invoke(self, prompt: str) -> ArcticQuiz:
        chunks = []
        for chunk in self.llm.stream(prompt):
            chunks.append(chunk)

        output = "".join(chunks)
        return ArcticQuiz.parse_obj(json.loads(output))
```

With this, the Streamlit app code is kept clean, but also it ensures that the model response is only further used when
it is valid. In theory, this can be extended with more specific validation rules using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

### Prompt generation

The prompt generation is a key aspect of the app. It is modularized and allows for easy adjustments. All logic is covered
in the `PromptGenerator` class.

The Prompt Generator combines and renders Jinja template files to create a modular prompt.

Jinja is a template engine for Python. Jinja facilitates the creation of dynamic content across various domains. It
separates logic from presentation, allowing for clean and maintainable codebases.

It uses the following core concepts:

* **Templates**: Text files containing content specific to the use case (e.g., HTML, configuration files, SQL queries).
* **Environment**: Manages template configuration (e.g., delimiters, autoescaping).
* **Variables**: Inserted into templates using double curly braces (`{{ variable }}`).
* **Blocks**: Defined with `{% ... %}` tags for control flow (e.g., loops, conditionals).
* **Comments**: Enclosed in `{# ... #}` for code readability.

Even though Jinja is often used in web development, since it enables the creation of dynamic content, it is also used
for other cases like Airflow.

In this project, it is used to define templates to make the prompt generation modular. That way, our Python code is kept
clean and we have a modular solution that can easily be extended.

LangChain is used to render the templates. That would allow to replace Jinja with another templating engine if needed.

For this project, there is a base template `prompt.jinja` which holds various variables which are replaced with the
data model, samples and others.

Depending on the selection of the user, another template for the difficulty of the quiz (e.g. `easy.jinja`) is rendered
and integrated into the base template.

### Data models

The data models are separated in the `models/` directory. Even though there are pre-defined scenarios for the current
application, it is easy to extend the app with new models.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Accomplishments that I'm proud of

There are four main outcomes that I am happy of:

- The product is actually fun to use. I enjoyed answering the questions generated by the model.
- The app stands out with the visual style applied.
- Parts of the project can be used for other Arctic projects, like the modular prompt generator.

Last but not least, the most important aspect, this project is a proof of concept that Arctic can be used to create
educational games and knowledge sharing app based on code generation with comparable low effort.

## üìö What I've learned

- Combining up-to-date Python functionality with validation libraries like Pydantic is very powerful and can be used to ensure good data quality for LLM input.
- The Instruct version of the Snowflake Arctic model family is powerful for all code generation tasks, including SQL.
- Streamlit is a great tool to get smaller applications and prototypes up and running quickly.
- Even though it does not seem like it, Streamlit allows for much more complex visual adjustments than one might think.
- Using a session state combined with the `st.empty()` element allows for complex user flows with a single page approach.

## üöÄ What's next for Arctic Query Quest

- **Custom models**: Allow users to upload their own data models and generate quizzes based on them.
- **Multiplayer mode**: Add a multiplayer mode to compete with friends or colleagues.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard to track progress and compare scores.

But most important: 

> I hope to encourage the development on educational games and knowledge sharing apps. I think it is
crucial to not only focus on getting a specific answer from a model but to enable users to learn and understand the
underlying concepts, like getting familiar with a data model.
