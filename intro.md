Welcome to the exciting **Arctic Query Quest**! Explore the world of SQL through an interactive journey powered by the
[Snowflake Arctic](https://www.snowflake.com/de/data-cloud/arctic/) model family.

The project leverages the robustness of the [Snowflake Arctic](https://www.snowflake.com/de/data-cloud/arctic/) model,
designed for enterprise-level applications, to create a unique learning experience. Arctic Query Quest not only generates
SQL queries based on data models but also focuses on knowledge sharing and learningâ€”an often overlooked aspect of
`Data engineering`, `Analytics`, and `Software Development`.

The system is based on a **modular approach**, that enriches prompts with data models and sample data to create interactive quizzes.
This innovative method allows users to _learn SQL while familiarizing themselves with the underlying data structure_.

This prototype has vast potential. Imagine replacing the demo data models with a company's actual model to onboard new
employees or enhance SQL proficiency. With further refinement, this platform could also revolutionize SQL education in
educational institutions like schools and universities.

This project was created as part of the [THE FUTURE OF AI IS OPEN](https://arctic-streamlit-hackathon.devpost.com/)
2024 Hackathon.
